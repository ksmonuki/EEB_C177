##My Favorite Animal

My favorite animal is the blue whale (***Balaenoptera musculus***)

Here are several interesting facts about the blue whale: 

*The blue whale is a baleen whale and feeds mostly on krill

*Boat activity can disrupt whale sonar communication and can disrupt whale foraging, leading some whales to abandn feeding. 

*Though the blue whale has a large mouth and tongue, they have very small throats and cannot swallow objects larger than a beach ball. 

*The blue whale is one of the loudest animals on the planet!
